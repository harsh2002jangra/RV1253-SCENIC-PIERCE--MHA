PROBLEM STATEMENT Al based solution for predicting major law order incidents

Solution Approach
We are developing a dynamic Web application for Predicting the Major Law and Order Incidents
using AI and Natural Language Processing Machine Learning Concepts and technologies like
Flutter, SDK, PYTHON, DJANGO, REACT, JAVASCRIPT and DEEP LEARNING MODELS NLP
•
The solution will take the inputs like PCR Call key words, Time of call, location, month, calendar
of festivals/political events, community involved, distribution of similar PCR Calls, etc to allow
Command Room Officers to flag indicators of serious law &order issue at the very initial stages
for timely intervention
•
The model will classify and relate the crimes happening involved with community involved
•
With the help of PCR Call input Natural Language Processing Model decide the
happening of crime &its types
•
BERT Algorithm tag classify happening of crime on basis of keywords with Lexicon
approach and Sentiment Analysis
•
XGB Random Forest model to classify predict crime on basis of events, date and
month
•
Predict Crime law Order disturbance on basis of Events, Location and Community
•
Send Alert to PCR Stations Police Station by indicating Law Order issue on basis of
